Extreme care shall be taken to avoid numerous issues that can arise in a \\njoint trust such as determining which spouse contributed which property, how separate \\nproperty and/or joint property are distributed and how marital, estate tax exemption and \\nasset protection trusts are funded at death.  Joint trusts can also cause inadvertent tax \\nconsequences.
